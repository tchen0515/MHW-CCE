This live script illustrates the process from the quality control of biological data to plotting the final fugures used in the manuscripts. In addition to the main processes (statistic analyses and figure plotting), the codes for the processes before the main analyses, including data quality control, calculating anomaly and dectect co-occurrence, are also provided here.
Statistical analysis
We conduct the statistical analysis using the biological anomalies data with MHW characterisitcs. Those data have been combined into two main tables (MHW-in situ data.xlsx and MHW-satalliteChla.xlsx). The output includes: the Spearman's rank coefficients and the parameters of Model II regression (using package from gmregress - File Exchange - MATLAB Central (mathworks.com)) of the anomalies of each biological variable and MHW characterisitcs (SD intensity & duration). Since the statistical results of each datasets are seperately generated, those results were then manually binned into a main table for supplementary (File: Statistical_analyses). Also, because we obnly focus on the southern CCE region, some codes have the section of exclusing the data sampled in the northern CCE region.
In each code, all transformed data were then tested for normality before conducting any statistical analysis.
