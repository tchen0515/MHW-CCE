# MHW-CCE
The files contains the codes used in Chen et al: Multi-trophic level responses to marine heatwave disturbances in the California Current Ecosystem

These codes can mainly be catgorized into four parts: data pre-processing, anomalies calculation, statistical analyses and figure generating. 

The process of the analysis is elaborated in Main_MHWbio.mlx. The data sources are indicated in the manuscript.

# Requirement
m_mhw1.0 and fitmethis are recommended for analysis

m_map is recommended for generating figures

R package "bestNormalize" are needed for Yeo-Johnson power transformation
